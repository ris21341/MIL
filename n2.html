    <p>Arwind Santos will serve as commissioner of the new National Basketball
      Championship Inter-High League in addition to his job as a player in the
      MPBL.</p>

    <p>PAMPANGA, Philippines (AP) â€” Arwind Santos, a former PBA Most Valuable
      Player, will juggle two duties after joining MPBL squad Pampanga Green
      Lanterns as a late signee.</p>

    <p>Santos will serve as commissioner of the National Basketball Championship
      Inter-High (NBCIH), a new league dedicated to finding the best secondary
      school team in the country, just days after tallying 4 points and six
      rebounds
      in a starting role for top-seeded Pampanga in an 82-70 win over Marikina
      in
      Game 1 of their MPBL quarterfinals.</p>

    <p>"I'm happy [to take the role] because I always leave my opportunities to God,"
      Santos stated in Filipino at the league's press conference here in
      Mabalacat.
      "I am thankful for the opportunity to help young athletes not just in Pampanga but the whole country,"
      he said.</p>

    <p>"I hope this won't be a short-term [deal], so we can have a steady stream of athletes that can be guided correctly."</p>

    <p>The league will begin on Friday, October 13, at the Bren Z. Guiao
      Convention
      Center in San Fernando, Pampanga, with eight Kapampangan schools competing
      in
      a do-or-die format for the right to represent their province in the grand
      finals. St. Augustine Institute of Pampanga will compete against Don Bosco
      Academy, while St. Vincent Academy of Apalit will compete against Sta.
      Cruz
      Academy of Lubao.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Pampanga Colleges will square off against Holy Angel
      University,
      and St. Mary's Academy of Guagua will square off against Guagua National
      College.</p>

    <p>Following the Pampanga leg, there will be three days of knockout games in
      15
      other areas in Luzon, including Cagayan Province, Ilocos, Pangasinan, and
      the
      National Capital Region, as well as eight in Visayas and Mindanao,
      including
      Bohol, Leyte, Cebu, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro, Butuan, Zamboanga, and Davao
      City.</p>

    <p>The competition, created by Jams Sports, a subsidiary of Jamsap
      Entertainment
      Corporation, will give the grand champion a P1 million cash prize. After
      the
      Pampanga leg, the games will be televised live on Jamsap TV and streamed
      on
      the Jamsap Entertainment app.</p>

    <p>"We are hoping the NBCIH can help young athletes to fulfill or jumpstart their dreams of earning college scholarships while pursuing their passion for the game,"
      stated Jojo Flores, chief executive officer of Jamsap - www.rappler.com</p>
